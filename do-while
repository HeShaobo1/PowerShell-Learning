The Do…While loop construction in Windows PowerShell is a bottom evaluated version of the While loop that I talked about in PowerShell Looping: Using While. The whole idea is that I am going to do something while a condition exists. As an example, here is a recent weather forecast for Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Scripting Wife and I live:


Do

{

  Ride bike

} (While (weather –eq ‘sunny’)

Examples:
do {
Get-Date;
} while ($false)
